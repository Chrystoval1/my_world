# MyWorld Project

## Overview  
**MyWorld** is a 2D world simulation game developed as part of the Epitech curriculum. The game is written in **C** and leverages **CSFML** for 2D graphics rendering and user interaction.

## Features  
- 2D graphics rendering  
- User interaction  
- Game logic and simulation

## Prerequisites  
Before building and running the project, ensure the following software is installed on your machine:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection)  
- **CSFML** (for graphics and user input handling)  
- **Make**

## Building the Project  
To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to build the project:

   `make`

This will:
- Compile the source code.
- Create an `obj` directory for object files.
- Place the executable in the `bin` directory.

## Running the Project  
Once the project is built, you can run the game by executing the following command:

   `./bin/myworld`

## Cleaning Up  
To remove compiled files and clean up the project, run:

   `make clean`

This will delete the `obj` and `bin` directories along with all compiled files.

## Customization  
You can customize the **Makefile** to adjust compiler flags or add additional source files to suit your needs.

## Contributing  
If you'd like to contribute to the project:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Submit a pull request with your changes.
